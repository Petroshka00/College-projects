# College-projects
A collection of all my college projects that i've worked on along the years, at the Universidad de Buenos Aires.

Some files are written in spanish as it was needed for the projects themselves, in each folder you may find an explanation of the program.





TP 3: 
  This project was about file handling (.csv files), writing in files (while mantaining the order they are in), eliminating specific lines from them or altering them.
